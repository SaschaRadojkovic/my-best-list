# This is my first todo list app created with react

It has the ability to to add new todo's .
you can check and line-trough done todo's.
and you can delete todo's.
you can save and reload to dos from your local browser storage.
to enter a new todo you can use the ADD button or press "Enter".

## Styling

The styling is a component library from [MUI-Library](https://mui.com/)
i did this together with a friend because my skills are not so far yet. Because i am learning web development as a newbie.
but this helped me a lot in understanding the React styling posibilities

### Future Features

- delete all lined-through todo's with one button.
- add tags for different categories
- give more options for todos like dates and maybe a creator name.
